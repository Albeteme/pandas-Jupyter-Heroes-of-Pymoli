# My Panda
On this project, I worked on a dataset from a fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 
So I analyzed the data to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
My final report should include each of the following:

Player Count:Total Number of Players

Purchasing Analysis (Total):
Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price
Total Number of Purchases
Total Revenue

Gender Demographics:
Percentage and Count of Male Players
Percentage and Count of Female Players
Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

Purchasing Analysis (Gender)broken by gender:
Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

Age Demographics broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.):
Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group
